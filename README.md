# Sweep

## What is sweep?

Sweep is a version of the more fabulous [Ferris](https://github.com/pierrechevalier83/ferris) by [Pierre Chevalier](https://github.com/pierrechevalier83/) that uses a daughter board like a promicro, elite-c, bit-c, nice!nano etc. instead of using onboard components.

## What are the different types?

There's only choc version of Sweeps, unlike the Ferris, which offers many different versions for different switch types. 


* Sweep Compact - this is based on the Ferris compact.
* Sweep Compact Low - this uses pg1232 or 'choc minis' rather than the standard choc v1 switch.
* Sweep Compact BLE - basically the compact, with the trrs removed and reversable controller footprint.
* Sweep34 - this was the OG Sweep, before there was a choc spaced Ferris, I consider it retired now, and would use the Sweep Compact.

## Firmware

The firmware can be found with the Ferris firmware as part of QMK. 

## BOM

To build a Sweep you will need:

* 2x promicro compatible boards
* 34 choc switches
* 2x reset switches (optional)
* Some little rubber feet/bumpers

## Who made this?

* Pierre Chevalier
* David Barr
* [Ibnu Daru Aji](https://github.com/ibnuda/)
